# PV-Potential on SBB-Areas
The goal of the project is to assess the PV-potential of areas owned by SBB. We use a dataset from SBB containing: Jahresverbrauch, Anschlüsse, and Gebäude-shapes, for each address.
On this dataset we did a general potential analysis over all addresses.
For a more detailed assessment and visualization of potential "Zussammenschlüsse" of adjoining parcels we linked the SBB data with the swiss energy planning app of geoimpact which collects, links, and visualizes several open datasets (e.g., from Sonnendach, Elcom, ...)

# Assessment and Visualization of parcels and potential "Zusammenschlüsse"
When you want to find "Zusammenschlüsse" you need to consider the geographic locations of the SBB-parcels, most importantly if two parcels are linked to each other through parcels that belong all to the same owner. In the case of SBB the ownership of train-track-parcels is especially interesting as they link different parcels over a large range (possibly over the whole country), which allows potentially for huge "Zusammenschlüsse" (see figure). However, it is not clear yet if the connection across train tracks is physically feasible and makes economically sense.
