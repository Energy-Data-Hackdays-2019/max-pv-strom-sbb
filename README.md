# PV-Potential on SBB-Areas
The goal of the project is to assess the PV-potential of areas owned by SBB. We use a dataset from SBB containing: Jahresverbrauch, Anschlüsse, and Gebäude-shapes, for each address.
On this dataset we did a general potential analysis over all addresses.
For a more detailed assessment and visualization of potential "Zussammenschlüsse" of adjoining parcels we linked the SBB data with the swiss energy planning app of geoimpact which collects, links, and visualizes several open datasets (e.g., from Sonnendach, Elcom, ...)
